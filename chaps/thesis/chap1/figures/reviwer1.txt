Reviewer #1: The paper presents an interesting exponential scheme for the Vlasov equation. In particular, the spatial direction is discretized by Fourier method and being integrated by an exponential method; while the velocity space is being discretized by finite difference scheme. Stability has been investigated and applications to several test problems for the Vlasov-Poisson have been presented. A few major comments that I have are the following.

1. a helpful test to check about the stability of the scheme could be a very simple linear equation, f_t + f_x + f_v =0, but with discontinuous initial data, say taking different values in four quadrants of the x-v plane (like a Riemann problem). Because of the discontinuity, hence the significance of high frequency mode, if there is any numerical instability, it could show up easily (easier than a smooth initial data). In the stability study of the paper, the authors tested the situation when the amplification factor is 1+\eps with \eps = 0.01. It seems that this still could lead to instability.

2. For the discontinuous initial data as suggested above, one can compare the linearized WENO scheme with the true WENO scheme in terms of their performance in controlling numerical oscillations. This will be helpful for the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson, especially when the numerical mesh under-resolve the solution structure. For example, the strong Landau damping at a long time T.
